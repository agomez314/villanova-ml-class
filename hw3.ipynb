    "For this assignment, your goal is to implement the ID3 algorithm (greedy information-gain based decision tree induction).  You should use the Congressional Voting Records data set, which I will show you how to load below.  This is a discrete multivariate dataset, which is well suited to decision trees.\n",

Also, since SKLearn expects numeric vector data, you'll need to do extra pre-processing before it will accept this data set._\n",
